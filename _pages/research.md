# Research

## Objective
The goal of any ideal image-guided surgery system is to report the position of an intra-operative tool within the brain, heart or other organ with perfect accuracy. However, most image-guided surgery systems use preoperative image information, and their accuracy is affected by many factors. Such factors include:
* Geometrical inaccuracy of images
* Organ and tissue shift between imaging and surgery
* The inability to visualize all of the required information in a single image
* Tracking of instruments with respect to human organs
* The surgeons’ interpretation of the information displayed

We are addressing these problems through research aimed at integrating intra-operative 3-D ultrasound with MRI during surgical guidance, the development of electrophysiological atlases to guide the surgeon during deep brain surgery, the use of computer simulations to guide minimally invasive cardiac and abdominal surgery; the integration of endoscopic images with the previously acquired 3-D volumes; and the development of virtual-reality visualization systems that can present these composite images to the surgeon in the operating room in a simple and intuitive fashion.

## Technology

### Software

**Echelon** - An image guidance platform based on the Atamai Viewer, specifically designed specifically for real-time intracardiac IGS.
A paired-down version of Echelon is licensed to NeoChord (under the name ‘NeoNav’) for use in their image guidance system.

**Slicer** - The Peters' group members make extensive use of 3D Slicer (http://www.slicer.org) for image segmentation, registration, fusion and processing. Applications include DTI analysis, image-guidance for cardiac and neurosurgery procedures, MR/ultrasound fusion, machine learning and more.

### Hardware

**Computation** - The VASST lab is equipped with considerable computing power. Current resources include:
* several GPU-enabled workstation grade machines for image processing experimentation
* two rack-mounted compute clusters with 4 NVIDIA Tesla® C2075 co-processors running Ubuntu linux
* one rack-mounted computer cluster with 4 NVIDIA Tesla® C2075 co-processors running Microsoft® Windows 7

**Mixed Reality** - Research into mixed reality has been accelerated by the commercialization of head mounted displays. Mixed reality visualization is an active area at the Peters lab with devices such as the Oculus Rift DK2, Vuzix AR and Google Cardboard providing stereoscopic vision of 3D Slicer environments.

**Imaging** - Being a Robarts Imaging lab, access to imaging technology is extensive. Current assets include multiple 2D ultrasound machines with several linear, curvelinear, single element and trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) probes, a Philips iE33 3D ultrasound machine with X7-2t TEE probe, C-arm and O-arm X-Ray imaging as well as 3T, 7T and 9.4T research grade MRI machines.

**Phantoms** - Our facilities include both manufactured and purchased phantoms including:
* unique beating heart phantom (proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx)
* skull covered brain phantom
* mixed reality neurosurgery phantom
* z-bar ultrasound calibration phantom
* carotid artery and jugular vein phantom for central-line procedures
* spine phantom for spinal duratomy procedures and epidural injection procedures

Rapid Prototyping

The VASST Lab has completely adopted 3D printing of plastic and metal as a method of decreasing the time required to iterate phantom and accessory design. Plastic printing includes an Objet30 Pro polyjet and an Ultimaker Extended Volume FDM using acrylic polymers, ABS and PLA. Metal printing includes a Sinterstation® Pro DM125 capable of additivly manufacturing stainless steel and cobalt chrome.

Position Tracking

Position tracking is an integral part of research in the lab. Magnetic and optical tracking are the most commonly used technologies including NDI Aurora, Polaris Vicra and Spectra, Ascension MTS and Micron trackers. We are also researching the incorporation of intertial measurement devices for aiding surgical tasks.

Other

We currently have several methods for displaying stereoscopic images and video. Currently in the lab are numerous high-definition flat-panel stereoscopic displays and a novel autostereoscopic monitor from Dimension Technologies Inc.



# Research

Our overarching goal is to explore and understand new quantum states of electronic matter on the atomic scale. To do so, we use and develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom.

Our goal is to build instruments and develop techniques that enable us to address the questions we find most interesting. This is possible thanks also to Milan's broad background with different research themes and technologies: he learned his trade in [Seamus Davis’ SI-STM lab](http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/) and with [Felix Baumberger](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html), and later moved as an [ETH fellow](http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/) to [Andreas Wallraff’s qudev lab](http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/) where he investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. We further have group members with different background and interests, working together on physics and instrumentation.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Scanning tunneling noise spectroscopy (STNS).** We have developed a novel cryogenic MHz amplifier that allows us to measure not only the average tunneling current, but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.


**Mott physics and high-temperature superconductivity.** Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high? We have worked on iridates, rhodates, and cuprates.

**Nanofabricated "Smart Tips"**.

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.

**Josephson STM.** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.

We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.


**Strange Metals.** The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the 'Strange Metal consortium NL' that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren. 

**Magnetic fluctuations and electron spin resonance.**

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.
