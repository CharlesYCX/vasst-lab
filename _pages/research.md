# Research

## Objective
The goal of any ideal image-guided surgery system is to report the position of an intra-operative tool within the brain, heart or other organ with perfect accuracy. However, most image-guided surgery systems use preoperative image information, and their accuracy is affected by many factors. Such factors include:
* Geometrical inaccuracy of images
* Organ and tissue shift between imaging and surgery
* The inability to visualize all of the required information in a single image
* Tracking of instruments with respect to human organs
* The surgeons’ interpretation of the information displayed

We are addressing these problems through research aimed at integrating intra-operative 3-D ultrasound with MRI during surgical guidance, the development of electrophysiological atlases to guide the surgeon during deep brain surgery, the use of computer simulations to guide minimally invasive cardiac and abdominal surgery; the integration of endoscopic images with the previously acquired 3-D volumes; and the development of virtual-reality visualization systems that can present these composite images to the surgeon in the operating room in a simple and intuitive fashion.

## Technology

### Software

**Echelon** - An image guidance platform based on the Atamai Viewer, specifically designed specifically for real-time intracardiac IGS.
A paired-down version of Echelon is licensed to NeoChord (under the name ‘NeoNav’) for use in their image guidance system.

**Slicer** - The Peters' group members make extensive use of 3D Slicer (http://www.slicer.org) for image segmentation, registration, fusion and processing. Applications include DTI analysis, image-guidance for cardiac and neurosurgery procedures, MR/ultrasound fusion, machine learning and more.

### Hardware

**Computation** - The VASST lab is equipped with considerable computing power. Current resources include:
* several GPU-enabled workstation grade machines for image processing experimentation
* two rack-mounted compute clusters with 4 NVIDIA Tesla® C2075 co-processors running Ubuntu linux
* one rack-mounted computer cluster with 4 NVIDIA Tesla® C2075 co-processors running Microsoft® Windows 7

**Mixed Reality** - Research into mixed reality has been accelerated by the commercialization of head mounted displays. Mixed reality visualization is an active area at the Peters lab with devices such as the Oculus Rift DK2, Vuzix AR and Google Cardboard providing stereoscopic vision of 3D Slicer environments.

**Imaging** - Being a Robarts Imaging lab, access to imaging technology is extensive. Current assets include multiple 2D ultrasound machines with several linear, curvelinear, single element and trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) probes, a Philips iE33 3D ultrasound machine with X7-2t TEE probe, C-arm and O-arm X-Ray imaging as well as 3T, 7T and 9.4T research grade MRI machines.

**Phantoms** - Our facilities include both manufactured and purchased phantoms including:
* unique beating heart phantom (proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx)
* skull covered brain phantom
* mixed reality neurosurgery phantom
* z-bar ultrasound calibration phantom
* carotid artery and jugular vein phantom for central-line procedures
* spine phantom for spinal duratomy procedures and epidural injection procedures
and more...

**Rapid Prototyping** - The VASST Lab has completely adopted 3D printing of plastic and metal as a method of decreasing the time required to iterate phantom and accessory design. Plastic printing includes an Objet30 Pro polyjet and an Ultimaker Extended Volume FDM using acrylic polymers, ABS and PLA. Metal printing includes a Sinterstation® Pro DM125 capable of additivly manufacturing stainless steel and cobalt chrome.

**Position Tracking** - An integral part of research in the lab. Magnetic and optical tracking are the most commonly used technologies including NDI Aurora, Polaris Vicra and Spectra, Ascension MTS and Micron trackers. We are also researching the incorporation of intertial measurement devices for aiding surgical tasks.

**Other** - We currently have several methods for displaying stereoscopic images and video. Currently in the lab are numerous high-definition flat-panel stereoscopic displays and a novel autostereoscopic monitor from Dimension Technologies Inc.
