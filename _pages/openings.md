# Open positions

**The VASST Lab gladly welcomes new students and reseachers to our team.**

We are looking for individuals with passion, hardwork, and grit. You will have the opportunity to work on research that has clinical relevance and healthcare applications that aim to enhance patient treatment. 

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions

State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.

### Master projects for Western University students
If you are a Master student at Western University looking for a Master project, contact the VASST Lab (or any group member) by email or stop by the lab.

### BSc / Master students from elsewhere
Sometimes, we take Master's students, co-op students, or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants.
