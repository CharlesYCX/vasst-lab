- title: "Physical replication and validation of mathematical mitral valve models"
  image: parametric_mitral_valve.png
  description: Accurate models of the mitral valve are highly valuable for studying the physiology of the heart and its various pathologies, as well as creating physical replicas for cardiac surgery training. Currently, heart simulator technologies are used which rely on patient-specific data to create valve replicas. Alternatively, mathematical models of the mitral valve have been developed for computational applications. However, there are no studies that mathematically model both the mitral valveâ€™s leaflets and its saddle-shaped annulus in a single design together in current literature.

  image: xray_lung_nodule.png
  description: Existing field generators (FGs) for magnetic tracking cause severe image artifacts in X-ray images. While FG with radio-lucent components significantly reduces these imaging artifacts, traces of coils and electronic components may still be visible to trained professionals. In the context of X-ray-guided interventions using magnetic tracking, we introduce a learning-based approach to further reduce traces of field-generator components from X-ray images to improve visualization and image guidance.

- title: "Development and evaluation of an open-source virtual reality C-Arm simulator"
  image: c_arm_simulator_virtual_scene.jpeg
  description: C-Arm positioning for interventional spine procedures is often associated with a steep learning curve. This task requires mentally reconstructing 3D surgical tools and patient anatomy from a 2D X-ray image, which is non-trivial and acquired through years of experience. Standard training via apprenticeship-based programs must be limited due to the unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation. To this end, we propose a Virtual Reality C-Arm simulator for interventional spine procedure training. We implemented the simulator as an open-source module in Slicer, and evaluated its efficacy through a user study, recruiting medical residents and expert clinicians. Users showed an overall significant improvement in C-Arm placement with regards to angular accuracy (mean ~2 degree improvement), and total procedure time (mean 11 minutes less time).

- title: "The Role of the Temporal Pole in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: A Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Study"
  image: processed_tracts.png
  description: This study aimed to evaluate the use of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) to detect microstructural abnormalities within the temporal pole (TP) and its temporopolar cortex in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients. DKI quantitative maps were obtained from fourteen lesional TLE and ten non-lesional TLE patients, along with twenty-three healthy controls. Data collected included mean (MK); radial (RK) and axial kurtosis (AK); mean diffusivity (MD) and axonal water fraction (AWF). Automated fiber quantification (AFQ) was used to quantify DKI measurements along the inferior longitudinal (ILF) and uncinate fasciculus (Unc). ILF and Unc tract profiles were compared between groups and tested for correlation with disease duration.

- title: "3D US-Based Evaluation and Optimization of Tumor Coverage for US-Guided Percutaneous Liver Thermal Ablation"
  image: tumor_coverage_in 3D.png
  description: Complete tumor coverage by the thermal ablation zone and with a safety margin (5 or 10 mm) is required to achieve the entire tumor eradication in liver tumor ablation procedures. However, 2D ultrasound (US) imaging has limitations in evaluating the tumor coverage by imaging only one or multiple planes, particularly for cases with multiple inserted applicators or irregular tumor shapes. In this paper, we evaluate the intra-procedural tumor coverage using 3D US imaging and investigate whether it can provide clinically needed information.

- title: "Towards ultrasound-based navigation: Deep learning based IVC lumen segmentation from intracardiac echocardiography"
  image: trained_Unet_model_outputs.png
  description: Vascular navigation is a prerequisite to transcatheter cardiac interventions. The current standard approach to catheter navigation relies on real-time fluoroscopy, while this technique utilizes ionizing radiation and it places the interventionalist at risk for eye cataracts and cancer. The shielding equipment needed to mitigate these risks is associated with spinal issues and neck and back pain which has led towards the coining of the term "interventionalist's disc disease". A proposed alternative is to have an ultrasound-guided vascular navigation system where a catheter-based ultrasound probe scans the vessel and reconstructs the vascular roadmap, which can then be navigated by tracked guidewire or catheter.

- title: "Evaluating Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Precision at Varying Gradient Strength in High Spatial Resolution 3T MRI"
  image: fsaverage_space.png
  description: Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), an extension to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), aims to improve quantification of the hindered/restricted diffusion pattern due to microstructural complexity in the brain. But in order to capture the non-Gaussian diffusion behaviour of water molecules in biological tissues, stronger gradients larger than those employed in standard diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) are required. Here, we explored the test-retest reliability of DKI derived metrics with respect to different gradient strength in a high spatial resolution dataset.

  image: cadmodel_tissue_mimicking block.png
  description: This work aims to develop a simple, anatomically and haptically realistic vascular phantom, compatible with intravascular and intracardiac ultrasound. The low-cost, dual-layered phantom bridges the gap between traditional wall-only and wall-less phantoms by showing both the vessel wall and surrounding tissue in ultrasound imaging. This phantom can better assist clinical tool training, testing of intravascular devices, blood flow studies, and validation of algorithms for intravascular and intracardiac surgical systems.

  image: EM_field_patient_Jtip_guidewire.png
  description: Electromagnetic image guidance systems have emerged as more secure methods to improve the performance of several catheter-based minimally invasive surgical procedures. Small sensors are incorporated within catheters and guidewires in order to track and guide in real-time their position and orientation with a reduced intra- procedural radiation exposure and contrast agent injections. One of the major limits of these systems is related to the unsuitable sensorization strategy for the J-tip guidewires, due to the structural constraints of the sensor coils available on the market. In this work we present preliminary results on a sensors bending test in static conditions to assess whether and when the precision of the sensor remains unchanged and/or deteriorates.

- title: "A dynamic mitral valve simulator for surgical training and patient specific preoperative planning"
  image: mitral_valve_assembly.png
  description: Mitral valve disease affects 2% of the Canadian population and 10% of those over the age of 75. Mitral valve regurgitation is a common valve disease often requiring surgical intervention for repair or replacement. Repair is often preferred over replacement, as it is associated with improved outcomes. Current mitral valve repair training is typically limited primarily to intraoperative experience. Additionally, the outcome of complex repair procedures is often unknown preoperatively, and is particularly true of new, off-pump repair techniques. Further challenges include identifying the most effective repair technique based on patient pathology, as multiple approaches exist. We present a hemodynamically accurate mitral valve phantom for testing previously validated patient specific pathological mitral valves.

- title: "Endoscopic image enhancement with noise suppression"
  image: enhanced_endoscopic_images.png
  description: Stereoscopic endoscopes have been used increasingly in minimally invasive surgery to visualise the organ surface and manipulate various surgical tools. However, insufficient and irregular light sources become major challenges for endoscopic surgery. Not only do these conditions hinder image processing algorithms, sometimes surgical tools are barely visible when operating within low-light regions. In addition, low-light regions have low signal-to-noise ratio and metrication artefacts due to quantisation errors. As a result, present image enhancement methods usually suffer from heavy noise amplification in low-light regions. In this Letter, the authors propose an effective method for endoscopic image enhancement by identifying different illumination regions and designing the enhancement design criteria for desired image quality.
